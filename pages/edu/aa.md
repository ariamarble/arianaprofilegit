Central Wyoming College is a rural comprehensive community college that offers associate's and bachelor's degrees. The college is located in west-central Wyoming and serves Fremont, Hot Springs, and Teton Counties. The main campus lies in the Wind River Valley, a large lowland area bounded by mountains on three sides. The area has a wide range of environmental zones from cold desert to alpine. Lakes and streams are abundant. Gannett Peak, Wyoming's highest mountain, is in close proximity to where the Wind River Mountains adjoin the valley.
